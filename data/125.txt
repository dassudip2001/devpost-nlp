Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist leader and a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement against British rule. He was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, India, into a Bengali family. Bose studied at Presidency College in Calcutta and later went to study in the United Kingdom, where he became involved in the Indian independence movement.In 1921, Bose became the general secretary of the Congress Party and worked closely with Mahatma Gandhi, but he was soon at odds with Gandhi's nonviolent approach to Indian independence. In 1928, Bose was arrested for his involvement in the Indian independence movement and was subsequently expelled from the Congress Party.After his release from prison in 1931, Bose formed the Forward Bloc, a political party that advocated for complete independence from British rule. He was later elected as the President of the Indian National Congress in 1938 but was expelled from the party again in 1939 due to his differences with Gandhi and the party's leadership.During World War II, Bose sought the help of Axis powers such as Germany and Japan to help him liberate India from British rule. He established the Indian National Army (INA) with Japanese help and led them in a failed attempt to invade India from Burma in 1944. Bose died in a plane crash in August 1945 under mysterious circumstances.Bose is remembered for his strong nationalist beliefs, his charismatic leadership, and his role in the Indian independence movement. He is often referred to as Netaji (meaning "Respected Leader" in Hindi) in India, and his legacy continues to inspire many in the country.Subhas Chandra Bose had a remarkable political career, marked by his unwavering determination and fervent nationalism. Here are some of the highlights.Indian National Congress: Bose began his political career as a member of the Indian National Congress, which was then the dominant political party in India. He quickly rose through the ranks and became the party's president in 1938 and 1939.Ideological Differences: Bose had ideological differences with the Congress leadership, particularly Mahatma Gandhi. Bose believed that non-violent resistance was insufficient to achieve Indian independence, and he favored more militant methods.Formation of Forward Bloc: In 1939, Bose broke away from the Congress and formed the Forward Bloc, a political party that advocated for complete independence for India and a more aggressive approach to achieving it.Escape to Germany: In 1941, Bose escaped from house arrest in India and fled to Germany, where he sought help from the Nazis to fight for India's freedom. He formed the Indian Legion, a group of Indian soldiers who fought alongside the German army.Formation of the Indian National Army: Bose also formed the Indian National Army (INA), which was made up of Indian soldiers captured by the Japanese in Southeast Asia. The INA fought alongside the Japanese in Burma and other parts of Southeast Asia, with the goal of liberating India from British rule.Death: Bose died in a plane crash in 1945, under mysterious circumstances. His death remains a subject of controversy, with many people believing that he may have survived the crash and gone into hiding.

The `TfidfVectorizer` class is part of the `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` module in the Scikit-Learn machine learning library. It is used to convert a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features.In the context of the code snippet provided, the `TfidfVectorizer` class is used to create a TF-IDF vectorizer object named `Tfidfvc`. The object is fitted to the pre-defined set of sentences stored in the `sentance_tokens` list using the `fit_transform` method. The `tokenizer` argument is set to the `LemNormalize` function, which tokenizes the text, removes stop words and punctuation, and lemmatizes the remaining words. The `stop_words` argument is set to 'english', which specifies that common English stop words (such as "the" and "and") should be removed from the text.The resulting `tfidf` matrix represents the TF-IDF weights for each word in each sentence in the `sentance_tokens` list. The cosine similarity between the user's input and the set of sentences is then calculated using the `cosine_similarity` function, and the index of the most similar sentence is used to generate the chatbot's response.
